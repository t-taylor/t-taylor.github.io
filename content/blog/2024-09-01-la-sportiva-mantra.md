I've just bought a pair of la sportiva matras and thought I'd document my experience with them over a couple of months. I've seen a few reviews, but all of them were mostly first time experiences. I'm hoping to give a bit of a better long term perspective. I'll update this post as I go.

## Day 1

I had a very positive first session. Going from some Evolv Sharmans, they feel so sensitive. I loved this, as you can always feel when your feet aren't quite right. Saying that, it felt like if I wasn't right, they're very unforgiving. The sharmans let you get away with having a bit of a sloppy foot, but if you do the same with the matras, you're slipping. On the other side, sometimes the sharmans just slip without warning, as you're missing the sensitivity that will tell you that you're not quite on the hold.

Size wise, I've picked spot on. I'm a 9 in the sharmans, and I've picked a 41 EU in the mantras, which seems perfect. Note that if you're getting these in the UK, beware that the 41 and 41.5 both say they're a 7.5 UK in shops. This also varies between the 2023 mantras and the 2024 mantras, where the boundaries are a tiny bit different. Trying them on at home, I was a bit worried they would be too big, but on the gym, they feel perfect[^1]. I've got a wide foot, and I feel the shape is perfect for me. Considering they're pretty thin though, if they strech, they might get a bit loose, so time will tell.

[^1]: I'm a size 9 or 8.5 wide in UK size. I've got a pretty square foot as well.
