I've gone through a lot of laptops recently. These are my thoughs on them.

## Thinkpad x250

- Lasted me 6 years thorough 3 years of BSc computer science & MSc data science
- Only had to open it once to add a 1Tb hard drive
- Put various linux distros on and never had any hardware problems with any of it
- Never really felt the need to replace it. The only issue was it couldn't comfortably support multiple screens or run gamecube emulation.

## ASUS G14 2023

- First attempt at replacing the thinkpad
- Amazing screen. Loved the 16:10 & 120Hz and colours were great
- Amazing speakers. Best bass I've ever heard in a laptop
- Though I'd try going back to windows. I couldn't last. Windows 11 really, really sucks.
- Tried putting linux on it, but there's not great support, and had some issues with the multi gpu setup.
- Sold after ~2 months

## Framework 13 intel 13th gen

- Enticed me with the first class linux support.
- Liked the whole modular repairable deal
- 3:2 screen was nice, but not as good as the 16:10. Also 60Hz which is a big downgrade when you get used to 120
- Ended having MASSIVE issues
  * burnt with the fingerprint reader due to an electrical short
  * this short fucked up the trackpad and the mainboard sound card
  * got a free replacement mainboard
  * sound still didn't work due the speakers being killed from the original short
  * after speakers were replaced, worked fine for ~1 month and then suddenly refused to charge
  * had to replace the mainboard AGAIN
- After this, my dad took it off my hands. I've got a full time job and I don't have the time to spend messing around getting a laptop to work that shouldn't have these issues

## Tuxedo pulse 13 gen 3

- Looked perfect so I bought it: 16:10 120Hz screen, AMD cpu, linux fully supported, usb c charging.
- Been using it for ~5 months now. Very happy with it
- Great screen, ok speakers, no problems with linux compatibility
- Only gripe is the screws for the bottom plate are poor quality, so I stripped on trying to get the plate off for the second time.
